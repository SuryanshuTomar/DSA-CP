// => What is Two Pointer Pattern and When to use it ?
// 1. In many Problems involving Arrays or Linked List where you need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, we can use the Two Pointers Pattern to avoid looping over array multiple times.
// 2. The pointer in this case refers to an index of the array.
// 3. Because we use two pointers, we are able to process two elements per loop instead of just onemptied. Common patterns in the Two Pointers approach are: 
      // a. Two pointers, each starting from the beginning and the end until they both meet.
      // b. Fast and Slow pointers, one pointer moving at a slow pace, while the other pointer moves at faster pace than the other one.
