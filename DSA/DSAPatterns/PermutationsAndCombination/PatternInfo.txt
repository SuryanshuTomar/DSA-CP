=> Permutation Pattern -
- A permutation is a collection or a combination of objects from a set where the order or the arrangement of the chosen objects does matter. In other words, a permutation is an arrangement of objects in a definite order. So before deep dive into permutation letâ€™s have a brief discussion on factorial first.
- To find number of permuations = n!

Eg -
str = "abc";
permutations = ["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"];
no of permutataions => 3! = 6;
