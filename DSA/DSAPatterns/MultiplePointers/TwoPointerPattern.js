// => What is Two Pointer Pattern and When to use it ?

// 1. In many Problems involving Arrays or Linked List where you need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, we can use the Two Pointers Pattern to avoid looping over array multiple times.
// 2. The pointer in this case refers to an index of the array.
// 3. Because we use two pointers, we are able to process two elements per loop instead of just onemptied. Common patterns in the Two Pointers approach are:
//    a. Two pointers, each starting from the beginning and the end until they both meet.
//    b. Fast and Slow pointers, one pointer moving at a slow pace, while the other pointer moves at faster pace than the other one.

// Note:
// 1. Many Faang companies ask questions based on this pattern.
// 2. Multiple pointers also include 3-pointer, 4-pointer...etc. But these are rare in interviews.

// -> Important Points to Remember -
// 1. Physical Significance of the Pointer(what the pointer represents in the solution i.e. - pair, range, etc)
// 2. How to initialize a pointer.
// 3. How to move the pointer.
// 4. When to stop the pointer.
